    "summary": "As a software developer, Worked with different databases such RDBMS (Oracle 11g, MySql, and PostgreSQL), NoSQLs such as MongoDB, Hadoop, and Cassandra for mini projects with RESTFul web services (expressJs). High usage of Hadoop in my previous tenure with Nokia has increased my knowledge of Hadoop platform and NoSQLs. Efficient in converting front-end frameworks such as struts 2.0 (2 years) to the latest framework like ReactJS (1.5 years). Application development with proper Java design patterns and front-end design patterns such as MVC, Flux was an evident in getting high performance. Developed a full stack website on ReactJS and Flux architecture in Nokia and a sample website for a professor. Developed RESTFul web services for the web development. During my tenure, followed the best practices of coding standards like writing unit testing, static code analysis, code review and front end automation using selenium. My international trips to Hungary and Finland show my cross-site communication and collaborative work culture. The best performer, spot award and global technology innovation award are the recognition from Nokia which explain my commitments towards the work. I have taken several pieces of training like Test Driven Development, clean coding, Goal-directed design for UX design, the agile, nodeJS and ReactJS.",
